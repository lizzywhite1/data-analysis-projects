# data-analysis-projects

A collection of all my data analysis projects. 

- **Late July**: Ultramarathon Dataset: A dataset with over 7 million entries of UM competitors over the past two centuries. This project involved cleaning, formatting and standardising data as well as engineering new features all using Pandas. It also involved using Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualise data. To run, ensure you have a Kaggle api token.
